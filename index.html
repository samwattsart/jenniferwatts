        <p class="flow-text"> Eric Vale, EA, provides high quality tax preparation and advisement services, as well as accounting services. <br>  <p class="small"> What is an Enrolled Agent (EA)? <br>
An Enrolled Agent is a federally licensed tax practitioner who has proven technical expertise in the field of taxation.  Enrolled agents are empowered by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to represent taxpayers before all levels of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for audits, collections, and appeals. Only EAs, attorneys, Enrolled Actuaries and certified public accountants (CPAs) may represent taxpayers before IRS. <br><br> How can an EA help me?  <br>Enrolled agents advise, represent, and prepare tax returns for individuals, partnerships, corporations, estates, trusts, and any entities with tax-reporting requirements. The expertise of EAs in the continuously changing field of taxation enables them to effectively represent taxpayers audited by the IRS. <br><br> Privilege and the Enrolled Agent <br>By law, EAs are allowed a limited client privilege.  This privilege allows confidentiality between the taxpayer and the enrolled agent under certain conditions.  The privilege applies to situations in which the taxpayer is being represented in cases involving audits and collection matters.  It is not applicable to the preparation and filing of a tax return.  This privilege does not apply to state tax matters. <br><br>  Are enrolled agents required to take continuing professional education? <br> The IRS requires enrolled agents to complete 72 hours of continuing professional education, reported every three years, to maintain their EA status.  NAEA members are obligated to complete 90 hours per three-year reporting period.  Because of the knowledge necessary to become an EA and the requirements to maintain the license, there are only about 40,000 practicing EAs in the U.S. </p>
